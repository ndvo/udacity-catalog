# Catalog Application

This application was developed as part of the Udacity's nanodegree program.

It allows authorized users to create categories and items inside such categories.

Items and categories are saved with simple descriptions.

## Installation

To run this application, run:

<code>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code>

Then run 

<code>
python main.py
</code>

The application will create a base.db database if there is none and therefore needs write permission to this folder and file.
